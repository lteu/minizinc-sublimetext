Minizinc Sublimetext
====
It's a pity that SublimeText does not have the Minizinc Syntax.

How to import it in Sublime Text(MAC)?

- configuration.
- copy the file to the path:
\<user>\Application Data\Sublime Text\Packages\Minizinc\Minizinc.yaml
- open the file via SublimeText and "Press fn + F7" and this will generate <language>.tmLanguage file.
- Sytax is automatically loaded

In the configuration step, you need to first install "Package Controll" and then "AAAPackageDev". In this way you are free to create sytax by selecting "Tools > Packages > Package Developments > New Syntax Definition"


Keyworks list in the minizinc tutorial is not complete, as a result, we intend to perfert the syntax file over the time while learning this language.
