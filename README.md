MiniZinc Sublime text
====
MiniZinc syntax package for Sublime Text 3. 


## Installation:

1. Download this Repo
1. Move the folder `MiniZinc` to the Sublime Text Package directory.
	* The directory can be found by following `Sublime Text` -> `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages...` -> `User`
	* It generates a path like `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/MiniZinc/` 


## For developer:

- Please feel free to improve the ``src/MiniZinc.yaml``. In Sublime Text, by pressing `fn + F7`, you can generate new `*.tmLanguage` files.
- The `MiniZinc.sublime-completions` contains keywords used for auto-complete.
- To create a new language syntax from scratch, you need to enable the function ``Tools > Packages > Package Developments > New Syntax Definition``. This can be accomplished by installing first the `Package Control` then the `AAAPackageDev`. 

## Note that:
- This package contains all the keywords listed in the [MiniZinc Tutorial](http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-latest/minizinc-tute.pdf) which is not complete; we are improving it all the time.
- Currently this package is tested with Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 on MAC OSX.
